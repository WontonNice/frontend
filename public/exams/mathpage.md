1. Formulas and definitions of mathematical terms and symbols are **not** provided.

2. Diagrams other than graphs are **not** necessarily drawn to scale. Do not assume any relationship in a diagram unless it is specifically stated or can be determined from the information given.

3. Assume that a diagram is in one plane unless the question specifically states that it is not.

4. Graphs are drawn to scale. Unless stated otherwise, you can assume relationships according to appearance. For example, lines on a graph that appear to be parallel can be assumed to be parallel. This is also true for concurrent lines, straight lines, collinear points, right angles, etc.
