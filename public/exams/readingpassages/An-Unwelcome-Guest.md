### An Unwelcome Guest

1. *Yersinia pestis* – a rod-shaped bacterium first discovered in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin – is widely believed to have caused some of the most devastating epidemics in human history.

2. Modern researchers believe that the bacterium lives naturally in the fluids of a number of different rodents, like marmots, rats, prairie dogs, and gerbils. These small mammals act as hosts for the bacterium. Despite what one might think, the bacterium does not typically spread from rodents to humans directly. Instead, the bacterium is transmitted from host to host by means of a vector: the flea.

3. Fleas feed on the blood of various animals, including rodents and humans. Fleas are incredibly agile, and do not necessarily feed on a single animal for very long. They jump from animal to animal, biting and feeding whenever it can. Once a flea bites an infected animal – say, an infected rat – in order to feed on its blood, some bacteria becomes trapped in the flea’s digestive system. Once there, the bacteria remains undisturbed thanks to special properties in the flea’s digestive tract. When the flea jumps to a new animal – say, an uninfected rat – to feed, it introduces the bacteria from its digestive system into the new animal’s bloodstream. Thus, *Yersinia pestis* spreads from animal to animal – from rodents to humans, for example – primarily through the flea.

4. Once the bacterium has infected people, however, its transmission is no longer limited by the flea. If the bacterium has multiplied sufficiently and has progressed to a certain point, it can be spread from person to person through coughing, vomiting, and other contact with bodily fluids.

5. For much of human history, people lived in what many today would consider to be squalor. Indoor plumbing and access to fresh, clean water were extremely rare. Trash and human waste were often disposed of in the streets. Because of this, rats and other rodents lived in close proximity to humans; and where there are rodents, there are fleas and Yersinia pestis.

6. Modern scientists and researchers believe that it is these conditions and the unique properties of *Yersinia pestis* that led to two of the deadliest outbreaks of Bubonic Plague in human history: the Plague of Justinian in Asia Minor, during the sixth century, and the Black Death in Europe, during the 14th century. In both cases, researchers believe that the bacterium, which is not found in European rodents, traveled aboard ships and with caravans along trade routes from Asia to Europe. Once there, the new bacterium spread through rodents and humans alike, and killed quickly. All told, the Plague of Justinian likely resulted in the deaths of between 25-50 million people; historians estimate that the Black Death resulted in the deaths of between 75 and 200 million people.

7. Though devastating, these two plagues do not account for all deaths caused by the small, rod-shaped bacterium. Throughout the rest of the world – in Northern Africa and Asia, for example – people have also suffered from the Yersinia pestis for hundreds of years. It was not until sanitation and living conditions improved that plague outbreaks began to recede into history.
