        Read this excerpt from paragraph 2.

        **When these solar particles come in contact with the earth’s magnetic field, they excite atoms in the earth’s upper atmosphere. These atoms then give off energy in the form of light. The resulting lightshow sometimes looks like a corona, with rays emanating in all directions from a central point.**

    choices:
      - "A. explaining the cause and effect relationship between solar particle activity and the phenomenon of auroras."
      - "B. illustrating the ways that the motion of solar particles affects the size and color of an aurora."
      - "C. highlighting the appearance that auroras generally take when viewed from the planet it occurs on."

### Ethereal Beauty

1. In the north, they are known as the aurora borealis; in the south, they are known as the aurora australis. In both the northern and southern hemispheres, auroras light up the night skies in a dazzling display of otherworldly beauty.

2. Auroras occur primarily in very high latitudes near the Arctic and Antarctic. They are caused by particles in the solar winds blasted outward by the sun. When these solar particles come in contact with the earth’s magnetic field, they excite atoms in the earth’s upper atmosphere. These atoms then give off energy in the form of light. The resulting lightshow sometimes looks like a corona, with rays emanating in all directions from a central point. Other times, the auroras adopt a curtain-like appearance, arcing up from the ground and flowing through the sky. Some auroras can span for hundreds of miles and fill a stargazer’s entire field of vision.

3. Though these displays can come in a variety of colors, they are generally in three main color categories. Red-colored auroras occur only at the highest altitudes in the atmosphere. These tend to be only visible to the naked eye when there are strong solar winds. Green and blue-colored auroras can occur at lower altitudes, though the latter are rarer. However, auroras are not restricted to particular altitudes. Indeed, some auroras occur across a number of different altitudes simultaneously. When this happens, it is not uncommon to see a mix of yellow, pink, and other colors. In theory, an aurora of any color is possible, so long as it is a color that could result from the mixing of the three main aurora colors. Shades of red – for example, orange – are rarities, while yellow-green are fairly widespread.

4. Today we know the scientific reason for why auroras occur. Before humans understood the cause of these colorful lights, people have long been fascinated by them. Many cultures held them responsible for other events they could not explain. The Ancient Greek historian Seneca wrote that Roman Emperor Tiberius’ army witnessed an aurora so bright above the city that they hurried to douse the fire, which they thought was burning their home. In more recent times, people thought auroras had spiritual or mystical causes. Many of the Native American tribes of North America believed the auroras were dancing spirits. Similarly, the aborigines of Australia believed the auroras were campfires of spirits in the afterlife, and only male elders were allowed to look at the auroras to receive these mysterious messages. Sixteenth century Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe, thought the aurora displays caused infectious diseases and recommended sulfur as a cure. Other Medieval Europeans believed the auroras to be signs from God. This idea was still held as recently as the American Civil War. An aurora was seen after the Battle of Fredericksburg, which led some soldiers to believe that God supported their cause.

5. The phenomenon of auroras is not unique to our planet. The Hubble Telescope has observed auroras on many other planets in our galaxy. Jupiter and Saturn, for example, are home to auroras that are larger and brighter than those on Earth. The Hubble has even observed auroras on Venus and Mars. Because each planet’s atmosphere is different, the colors of the auroras themselves can vary widely.

6. Even though we now know the physical cause of auroras’ appearances in the night sky, this knowledge hasn’t lessened people’s appreciation for these beautiful sights. In fact, these light displays are famous throughout the world. Since they can only be clearly seen in areas above 55 degrees latitude and with little light pollution, people travel from all over the world to places like northern Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia for a chance to see the borealis. And the australis, its southern equivalent, has even fewer places where it can be easily seen: accessible spots are limited to the southern tips of Tasmania in Australia and New Zealand. As a result of their popularity, many travel agencies now offer special tours, whose primary goal is to allow their clients to get great views of this natural wonder.
