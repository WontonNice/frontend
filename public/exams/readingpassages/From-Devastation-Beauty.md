### From Devastation, Beauty

1. Pablo Picasso was a prodigious producer of art. During his illustrious career, he often crossed artistic boundaries, creating everything from costumes and theater sets to ceramics, sculptures, drawings, and paintings. By some estimates, Picasso created more than 20,000 works of art in his lifetime. Despite this wide range of artistic pursuits, today, Picasso is perhaps most widely known for his paintings. Picasso’s paintings reflect his revolutionary sense of style and often tell important personal or political stories. There is perhaps no better example of Picasso’s artistry than *Guernica*, one of his most famous paintings.
 

2. The story of *Guernica* begins in early 1937, during the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish-born artist was commissioned by Spanish Republicans to create a mural for the World’s Fair in Paris. Picasso accepted the commission, and began looking for a subject for this work.
 

3. Not long thereafter, on April 26, 1937, the small Spanish town of *Guernica* was bombed by allies of Spanish Nationalists. According to the Nationalists, the bombardment was intended to target the town’s roads and bridges. This strategy was meant to hinder the movements of their enemy, the Spanish Republicans. Unfortunately, due to smoke from a previous attack, the bombers were unable to properly target the town’s infrastructure. Instead, they ended up destroying the town itself, massacring many innocent civilians. Many of the victims were unarmed women and children, since most of the town’s men had gone off to fight in the war. To make matters worse, April 26 was a market day – a day when farmers from surrounding areas would mingle with *Guernica* locals to buy and sell goods.
 

4. News of the attack on *Guernica* sparked shock and outrage around the world. On May 1, Picasso read about the bombing in George Steer’s eyewitness account, published on April 28 in *The New York Times* and *The Times*. Picasso decided then to make the bombing of *Guernica* the subject of his mural.
 

5. What resulted was *Guernica* – a large mural painting standing more than 11 feet tall and 25 feet wide. The painting depicts, in austere grays, blacks, and whites, the violence, suffering, and chaos produced by war. Picasso chose to use these shades to mirror the gravity of black-and-white photographs. The mural symbolically depicts the horrors of war: a horse, wounded by a spear, dying; a woman grieving over a dead child; a soldier grasping a broken sword; daggers emanating from the mouths of the injured, suggesting anguish and suffering.
 

6. Once completed, the mural was displayed at the Spanish Pavilion during the World’s Fair in Paris. The painting was, at first, met with mixed reactions. A German fair guide describes it as “a hodgepodge of body parts that any four-year-old could have painted.” Once the fair ended, *Guernica* went on European and North America tours, where critics shared their distaste for the artwork. Clement Greenberg, an American critic, called it “jerky” and “compressed.”
 

7. It was the working-class population that began to react positively to the piece. Picasso’s work was deliberately graphic, to express his indignation and anti-war feelings. *Guernica* challenged people’s perceptions of warfare, presenting it as violent and brutal instead of heroic and brave. This work resonated with ordinary people, who saw themselves and their loved ones, like the different subjects of the painting, as victims of the war.
 

8. Though the Spanish Civil War eventually came to an end in 1939, *Guernica* continued to stir emotions around the world. From 1985 to 2009, a copy of the painting was hung at the entrance to the United Nations Security Council room in the United Nations Building. This was a reminder of the horrors of war displayed in a place dedicated to diplomacy and the prevention of violence.
 

9. *Guernica* went on to inspire countless artists. In 2003, artist Sophie Matisse reimagined Picasso’s painting, in a reaction to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. Titled *911-Guernica*, the centerpiece of Matisse’s work highlighted the horrific attack on American civilians, mirroring how the original work highlighted the Spanish tragedy.
 

10. *Guernica* remains a cultural cornerstone. It is referenced in articles, blogs, and even consumer goods. Its symbolic message about warfare continues to be relevant today. *Guernica* is a painting meant not for a specific time and place, but for all of humanity.
