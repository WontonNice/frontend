### Healthier Choices

1. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 69% of adult Americans are either overweight or obese. Obesity is not only a problem facing adults. Some 17% of American children ages 2 to 19 are obese, as well.

2. Obesity has been linked to a host of health problems. Overweight or obese adults are at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and even some cancers. Overweight or obese children are particularly vulnerable to type 2 diabetes, and more than half of all children diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are obese.

3. Not only are these health problems dangerous and potentially fatal, but they are also extremely expensive to manage. According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2008 alone, obesity cost Americans nearly $150 billion in medical expenses. On top of this explicit cost are hidden costs associated with a loss of work productivity, estimated to be between $3-6 billion annually.

<ol start="4">
  <li>With such a high cost — to health, society, and economy — the question becomes:
      what can be done to reduce the rate of obesity in the country?</li>
</ol>

### A Simple Idea

<ol start="5">
  <li>One step taken to address obesity has been to require that certain restaurants
      and food retailers label their menus with the number of calories their foods and
      drinks contain. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) passed this
      regulation in December of 2014. With this rule, the FDA hoped to address one of
      the greatest factors contributing to obesity in America: the popularity of
      inexpensive, high-calorie food and drinks.</li>
  <li>A person’s weight is the result of many different factors that work together…</li>
</ol>

6. A person’s weight is the result of many different factors that work together. These factors range from those that cannot be controlled – like a person’s natural metabolism – to those that can. One controllable factor is a person’s diet. In the United States, food portions often contain more energy (i.e. calories) than they need to, or that people are aware of. Combined with the fact that Americans spend less and less time staying active, high-calorie foods and drinks – which are also inexpensive, convenient, and available in large quantities – have contributed to America’s soaring obesity rates.

7. The FDA hopes that by forcing vendors to label their products with the number of calories contained, people will be more likely to stop and think before purchasing yet another large soda or extra helping of fried chicken nuggets.

The Power of Information
8. Recently, New York City has taken steps similar to those taken in 2014 by the FDA. Starting December 2015, the New York City Board of Health required restaurants with 15 or more locations nationwide to post high-sodium-level warning labels on their menus. The City cited research that shows how high sodium intake can lead to obesity by encouraging people to overeat and over drink. The National Institutes of Health points out that there is a strong relationship between consuming salty foods and drinking high-calorie, sugary drinks. In addition to contributing to obesity, sodium is also, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, associated with high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease.

9. Hopefully, the more people are informed about their diet, the better able they will be to make healthier lifestyle choices.
