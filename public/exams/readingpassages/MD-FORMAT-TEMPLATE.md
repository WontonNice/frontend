### Lady Bird Johnson

1. Claudia Alta Taylor – or, Lady Bird Johnson, as she was commonly known – arguably created the modern idea of what it means to be the First Lady of the United States.

2. Nowadays, it’s not uncommon for accomplished, powerful women like Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton to be influential public figures in their own right. But it was not always so. In the mid-1900s, First Ladies were largely ornamental; it was expected, or even required, that they be seen and rarely heard. Ms. Johnson, though, stepped outside the restrictive social conventions of her time. In her own quiet way, she reinvented the role of political wife – so charmingly, so discreetly – that no one realized she had turned traditional gender roles on their head until long after upside-down already seemed right-side-up.
