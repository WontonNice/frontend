### Mapping the World with Satellites and Einstein's Theories

1. The Global Positioning System (GPS) has become an indispensable tool of modern life, seamlessly integrated into everything from smartphone maps to international shipping. Yet, the sophisticated science behind this seemingly magical technology is a marvel of physics and engineering. At its core, GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that allows a receiver on Earth to determine its precise location by calculating its distance from several orbiting satellites. This process, known as trilateration, relies on the astonishingly accurate measurement of time.

2. The GPS network consists of a constellation of about 30 satellites orbiting the Earth at an altitude of approximately 12,550 miles. Each satellite is essentially a hyper-accurate clock, carrying multiple atomic clocks that are precise to within a few nanoseconds (billionths of a second). Each satellite continuously broadcasts a signal that contains two key pieces of information: the exact time the signal was sent and the satellite’s precise orbital position at that moment. A GPS receiver on the ground picks up these signals.

3. The receiver’s task is to calculate its distance from each satellite. Since the radio signal travels at the constant speed of light, the receiver can determine this distance by measuring the time delay between when the signal was sent and when it was received. By multiplying this time delay by the speed of light, the receiver gets a distance measurement. This measurement places the receiver somewhere on the surface of an imaginary sphere with the satellite at its center and the calculated distance as its radius.

4. To pinpoint a location in three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude), the receiver must get a signal from at least four satellites. The signal from the first satellite narrows the receiver's location down to the surface of one sphere. The signal from a second satellite creates a second sphere, and the intersection of these two spheres is a circle. A third satellite signal narrows the location down to just two points on that circle. Finally, the signal from a fourth satellite is used to determine which of the two points is the correct location and, critically, to correct for any timing errors in the receiver’s own, less-accurate quartz clock. This fourth measurement is what provides the system’s remarkable precision.

5. However, this system would be useless without accounting for Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity. According to special relativity, because the satellites are moving so fast, their atomic clocks actually run slightly slower than clocks on the ground. Conversely, according to general relativity, because the satellites are in a weaker gravitational field far from Earth, their clocks run slightly faster. The effect of general relativity is stronger. Combined, the satellites’ clocks gain about 38 microseconds (millionths of a second) per day relative to Earth. It may seem insignificant, but if this relativistic effect were not corrected, GPS navigation errors would accumulate at a rate of about 6 miles per day, rendering the system completely useless. The everyday convenience of GPS is, therefore, a direct and practical confirmation of some of the most profound theories in physics.
