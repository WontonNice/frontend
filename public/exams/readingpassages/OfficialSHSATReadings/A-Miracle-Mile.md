### A Miracle Mile

1. In the 1950s people compared running one mile in four minutes to scaling Mount Everest and
nicknamed the feat a “dream mile.” Although such an accomplishment was considered humanly
impossible, several elite runners aimed to break that supposedly impenetrable barrier. One of them
was a twenty-five-year-old medical student named Roger Bannister.

2. Roger Bannister had tasted failure during the 1952 Olympics. There, he was favored to win the
1,500-meter competition, a distance slightly shorter than a mile, but he finished in a dismal fourth
place instead. Bannister’s performance was a disappointment for him and his country, Great Britain.
Determined to redeem himself, Bannister postponed his plans to retire from racing and focused on the
ultimate prize—breaking the four-minute-mile barrier.

3. Bannister attacked the elusive milestone with a positive attitude and logical planning. The amateur
athlete decided to use intensive interval training to develop endurance and speed. For these workouts,
Bannister ran an interval of ten consecutive laps on a quarter-mile track, aiming for sixty seconds
each lap. In between intervals, he let his body recover for two minutes.

4. By early 1954, Bannister had succeeded in lowering his quarter-mile pace to sixty-one seconds, but he
had to shave off at least one more second in order to reach his target. Frustrated by the plateau he
had reached, Bannister took a break from training and went mountain climbing for three days. The
rest from running permitted his muscles to recuperate and left him feeling refreshed. When Bannister
returned to the track, he completed ten quarter-mile-long intervals at fifty-nine seconds each. He
finally felt prepared to attempt to break the world record.

5. As a member of the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), Bannister joined the AAA team for a track
meet against Oxford University. The event took place on a cinder track in Oxford on May 6, 1954.
Bannister and his two AAA teammates, Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher, were close friends and
frequent running partners. Chataway and Brasher agreed to help Bannister accomplish his goal by
being his “rabbits.”

6. In track and field, rabbits are runners who enter the race solely to pace a teammate for a segment of
the course. Typically, a runner settles in behind the rabbit and allows the rabbit to set an appropriate
tempo. Additionally, by running behind the rabbit, the runner conserves about 15 percent of his or her
effort. When the starting pistol fired, Brasher pounced into the lead, and Bannister followed behind
his first rabbit.

7. Propelled by the excitement, Bannister lost his instinctive feel for his pace and shouted “Faster!” at
Brasher. Brasher, however, remained composed and maintained his current steady but grueling pace,
completing the first two laps in a desirable one minute and fifty-eight seconds. Then Chataway surged
forward, leading Bannister at this same punishing rate for another lap and a half. At the beginning of
the back straightaway of the track, Bannister bolted past Chataway. Bannister said, “I felt that the
moment of a lifetime had come. There was no pain, only a great unity of movement and aim.”
Bannister crossed the finish line in 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. The ecstatic crowd erupted the moment
the timekeeper announced the word “three.”

8. Soon after Bannister’s achievement, four other athletes matched his performance. A new mindset had
taken root among runners. Over the years, the record continued to fall. However, the current record,
3 minutes 43.13 seconds, has stood unbroken since 1999. Some question whether this record
represents the limits of human ability. But perhaps there is another Bannister, an athlete who, with
willpower and dedication, will accomplish the miraculous.
