### Excerpt from A Voice in the Wilderness

by Grace Livingston Hill

1. With a lurch the train came to a dead stop and Margaret Earle, hastily gathering up her belongings,
hurried down the aisle and got out into the night.

2. It occurred to her, as she swung her heavy suit-case down the rather long step to the ground, and then
carefully swung herself after it, that it was strange that neither conductor, brakeman, nor porter had
come to help her off the train, when all three had taken the trouble to tell her that hers was the next
station; but she could hear voices up ahead. Perhaps something was the matter with the engine that
detained them and they had forgotten her for the moment.

3. The ground was rough where she stood, and there seemed no sign of a platform. Did they not have
platforms in this wild Western land, or was the train so long that her car had stopped before
reaching it?

4. She strained her eyes into the darkness, and tried to make out things from the two or three specks of
light that danced about like fireflies in the distance. She could dimly see moving figures away up near
the engine, and each one evidently carried a lantern. The train was tremendously long. A sudden
feeling of isolation took possession of her. Perhaps she ought not to have got out until some one came
to help her. Perhaps the train had not pulled into the station yet and she ought to get back on it and
wait. Yet if the train started before she found the conductor she might be carried on somewhere and he
justly blame her for a fool.

5. There did not seem to be any building on that side of the track. It was probably on the other, but she
was standing too near the cars to see over. She tried to move back to look, but the ground sloped and
she slipped and fell in the cinders,1 bruising her knee and cutting her wrist.

6. In sudden panic she arose. She would get back into the train, no matter what the consequences. They
had no right to put her out here, away off from the station, at night, in a strange country. If the train
started before she could find the conductor she would tell him that he must back it up again and let
her off. He certainly could not expect her to get out like this.

7. She lifted the heavy suit-case up the high step that was even farther from the ground than it had been
when she came down, because her fall had loosened some of the earth and caused it to slide away from
the track. Then, reaching to the rail of the step, she tried to pull herself up, but as she did so the
engine gave a long snort and the whole train, as if it were in league against her, lurched forward
crazily, shaking off her hold. She slipped to her knees again, the suit-case, toppled from the lower step,
descending upon her, and together they slid and rolled down the short bank, while the train . . . ran
giddily off into the night.

8. The horror of being deserted helped the girl to rise in spite of bruises and shock. She lifted imploring
hands to the unresponsive cars as they hurried by her—one, two, three, with bright windows, each
showing a passenger, comfortable and safe inside, unconscious of her need.

9. A moment of useless screaming, running, trying to attract some one’s attention, a sickening sense of
terror and failure, and the last car slatted itself past with a mocking clatter, as if it enjoyed
her discomfort.

10. Margaret stood dazed, reaching out helpless hands, then dropped them at her sides and gazed after
the fast-retreating train, the light on its last car swinging tauntingly, blinking now and then with a
leer in its eye, rapidly vanishing from her sight into the depth of the night.

11. She gasped and looked about her for the station that but a short moment before had been so real to
her mind; and, lo! on this side and on that there was none!

12. The night was wide like a great floor shut in by a low, vast dome of curving blue set with the largest,
most wonderful stars she had ever seen. Heavy shadows of purple-green, smoke-like, hovered over
earth darker and more intense than the unfathomable blue of the night sky. It seemed like the secret
nesting-place of mysteries wherein no human foot might dare intrude. It was incredible that such
could be but common sage-brush, sand, and greasewood wrapped about with the beauty of the
lonely night.

13. No building broke the inky outlines of the plain, nor friendly light streamed out to cheer her heart.
Not even a tree was in sight, except on the far horizon, where a heavy line of deeper darkness might
mean a forest. Nothing, absolutely nothing, in the blue, deep, starry dome above and the bluer
darkness of the earth below save one sharp shaft ahead like a black mast throwing out a dark arm
across the track.

14. As soon as she sighted it she picked up her baggage and made her painful way toward it, for her knees
and wrist were bruised and her baggage was heavy.

15. A soft drip, drip greeted her as she drew nearer; something plashing down among the cinders by
the track. Then she saw the tall column with its arm outstretched, and looming darker among the
sage-brush the outlines of a water-tank. It was so she recognized the engine’s drinking-tank, and knew
that she had mistaken a pause to water the engine for a regular stop at a station.
