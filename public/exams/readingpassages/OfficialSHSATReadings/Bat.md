In many cultures, the ugly physical
appearance of the bat has given it an
unearned reputation as an evil and vicious
bearer of diseases. Many people, for example,
believe that little brown bats carry rabies. In
fact, they are no more likely to transmit the
disease than other animals, such as dogs.
Brown bats actually help prevent disease, not
spread it. The basis of their diet is the
mosquito, an insect that transmits more
diseases than all the bats in the world
combined.

A group of bat species known as flying foxes
or fruit bats serves another important
purpose as a critical link in the reproduction
of many tropical trees and shrubs. In the
tropical rain forests of Africa, Asia, and
Australia, plants such as avocados, date
trees, cashews, and mangoes rely in part on
flying foxes for pollination. One of Africa’s
most valuable hardwood trees, the iroko, is
entirely dependent on this type of bat for
pollination. Flying foxes feed on flowers, fruit,
and nectar, flying from one plant to another
and pollinating the plants as they go, much
as bees do in other parts of the world.
Because they are sloppy eaters, flying foxes
drop fruit as they go, dispersing the seeds.
They can travel great distances and convey
pollen and seeds far from their origins,
thereby maintaining the genetic biodiversity
within a plant species.

Because of the importance of bats’ role in
pollination and seed distribution, scientists
consider them a keystone in the ecosystems
of tropical rain forests. Without bats, many
bat-pollinated plants—and the animals that
depend on them for food and shelter—would
be threatened to the point of extinction.
Areas outside the rain forests would be
affected as well, since the rain forests’ lush
vegetation replenishes the oxygen in the
global atmosphere.

Unfortunately, many people are determined
to get rid of bats. Flying foxes are at
particular risk. In the wild, they feed on wild
fruit, but when their rain forest habitat is
reduced by conversion into farmland or
residential areas, they occasionally raid
cultivated fruit trees, spoiling the crops.
Several flying fox species have been hunted
to extinction, while others are seriously
endangered.

Conservation groups and government
agencies in many countries are attempting to
change people’s attitudes toward bats. When
people learn that bats pollinate the trees and
crops that provide their livelihood, they are
more likely to appreciate and protect the bats
in their area. There are also effective,
nonharmful ways to deal with troublesome
bats. Orchard owners can cover their trees
with netting to discourage the bats, and there
are humane methods for moving bats from
places where they are not wanted. For the
sake of the rain forests and for life-forms
everywhere that depend on them, it is urgent
that people apply a new twist to an old adage
and realize that ugliness is only skin deep.
