### Cross-Purposes

What I am is *built*: concrete and steel.
I defy gravity. I am what every athlete
wants: to remain at the apex of the leap,
up in the air. And yet I am useful, too:
cars, trucks, people, even trains
make their way across my broad back.
Swallows and ospreys nest in my trusses

*What I am is motion. I am water, and I am older*
        *than anything else you know. No human*
        *built me. I am gravity’s best friend; I pool*
        *and flow wherever gravity takes me.*
        *I am the blood flowing in the runner’s chest,*
        *and I catch everything: from the hills,*
        *the mountains. It all washes down through me.*

What you are is an *accident*,
what happens to rain when rain gives in
to Earth’s gravitational pull.
You are some tears dribbling from a mountain’s
eye, running down the pavements
of small towns, into the cities, to the sea.
You are the path of least resistance.

*What I am is power. You, of course,*
        *have none: you are a static lump, an artifact*
        *slowly decaying. But my regal flow*
        *nourishes grasses, permits empires to rise.*
        *Those who made you will break you,*
        *in time, replacing you with yet another*
        *clumsy structure. I have seen. I know.*

“Clumsy”? Being rebuilt makes me
a friend of time, does it not? And it means
that I have siblings—those “clumsy” structures,
my sisters and brothers.
We stitch across the rip you make.
We are steel thread to the human needle.
We bind you up. We sew you.

*And I sow into you; in every cranny*
        *of your superstructure my vapors cling.*
        *They bring out your softness, your rust.*
        *Boast your best, and boast better yet.*
        *I am listening to the bright hum*
        *of the wind in your wires. Because I am,*
        *above all else, patient. I will wait for you.*
