The British novelist Charles Dickens is well
known for the colorful and eccentric
characters he created in his many novels. But
one of his books, *David Copperfield*, seems to
have a great deal to do with fact as well as
fiction. After attempting to write his
autobiography, Dickens abandoned the
project and began to work on a novel, the plot
of which was loosely based on his own
boyhood experiences. Apparently, it was
easier for him to weave the events of his own
life into the fiction of *David Copperfield* than
to write about them in nonfiction.

Some of Dickens’s most troubling memories
involved a job he held in 1824 as a 12-yearold child. Because his family was deeply in
debt, he was forced to quit school and go to
work in a London factory, pasting labels on
pots of shoe polish. Dickens lived in a
boardinghouse, using his meager wages to
support himself and to help pay his family’s
debts. He worked in the dreary, run-down
factory six days a week from 8:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m. Such long hours were not unusual
at the time, for children or adults, but
Dickens was miserable during the entire four
months he spent working at the factory.

Even when the family finances improved,
Dickens continued to work at the factory
until his father quarreled with Dickens’s
boss, who promptly dismissed the son.
Dickens was upset at being fired but relieved
to be out of the factory. Thus he felt betrayed
when his mother, anxious for the boy’s weekly
wage, succeeded in making peace and getting
Dickens’s job back for him. The father,
however, now sided with his son, and the boy
was sent back to school. “I know how these
things have worked together to make me
what I am,” Dickens later wrote, but he never
forgot that his mother was eager for him to
return to work.

As an adult, Dickens always remembered the
shame and humiliation he felt during those
months at the factory. For years afterward,
whenever in London, he could not go near the
sites of the factory and boardinghouse, going
out of his way to avoid those painful
reminders of his past. In fact, Dickens never
told his wife and children about his childhood
work experience. It was only after his death
that they heard of it from a family friend
whom Dickens had confided in.

Instead, Dickens expressed his feelings by
giving his fictional “other self,” *David
Copperfield*, a job similar to the one he had so
hated. In the novel, ten-year-old David is
forced by his harsh stepfather to work as a
bottle washer in a factory. Young David, who
“suffered exquisitely” as a child manual
laborer, was apparently Dickens’s way of
dealing with his own past. *David Copperfield*
was to become Dickens’s most popular novel,
and Dickens himself called it his “favorite
child.”
