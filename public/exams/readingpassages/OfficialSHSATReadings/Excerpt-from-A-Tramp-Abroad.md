### Excerpt from A Tramp Abroad

by Mark Twain

1. Now and then, while we rested, we watched the laborious ant at his work. I found nothing new in
him—certainly nothing to change my opinion of him. It seems to me that in the matter of intellect the
ant must be a strangely overrated bird. During many summers now I have watched him, when I ought
to have been in better business, and I have not yet come across a living ant that seemed to have any
more sense than a dead one. I refer to the ordinary ant, of course; I have had no experience of those
wonderful Swiss and African ones which vote, keep drilled armies, . . . and dispute about religion.
Those particular ants may be all that the naturalist paints them, but I am persuaded that the average
ant is a sham.

2. I admit his industry, of course; he is the hardest working creature in the world—when anybody is
looking—but his leather-headedness is the point I make against him. He goes out foraging, he makes a
capture, and then what does he do? Go home? No; he goes anywhere but home. He doesn’t know where
home is. His home may be only three feet away; no matter, he can’t find it. He makes his capture, as I
have said; it is generally something which can be of no sort of use to himself or anybody else; it is
usually seven times bigger than it ought to be; he hunts out the awkwardest place to take hold of it; he
lifts it bodily up in the air by main force, and starts—not toward home, but in the opposite direction;
not calmly and wisely, but with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his strength; he fetches up against
a pebble, and, instead of going around it, he climbs over it backwards, dragging his booty after him,
tumbles down on the other side, jumps up in a passion, kicks the dust off his clothes, moistens his
hands, grabs his property viciously, yanks it this way, then that, shoves it ahead of him a moment,
turns tail and lugs it after him another moment, gets madder and madder, then presently hoists it into
the air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction; comes to a weed; it never occurs to him to
go around it. No; he must climb it, and he does climb it, dragging his worthless property to the top—
which is as bright a thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from Heidelberg to Paris
by way of Strasburg steeple; when he gets up there he finds that that is not the place; takes a cursory
glance at the scenery, and either climbs down again or tumbles down, and starts off once more—as
usual, in a new direction. At the end of half an hour he fetches up within six inches of the place he
started from, and lays his burden down. Meantime, he has been over all the ground for two yards
around, and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across. Now he wipes the sweat from his brow,
strokes his limbs, and then marches aimlessly off, in as violent a hurry as ever. He traverses a good
deal of zig-zag country, and by and by stumbles on his same booty again. He does not remember to
have ever seen it before; he looks around to see which is not the way home, grabs his bundle, and
starts. He goes through the same adventures he had before; finally stops to rest, and a friend
comes along.

3. Evidently the friend remarks that a last year’s grasshopper leg is a very noble acquisition, and
inquires where he got it. Evidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get it, but
thinks he got it “around here somewhere.” Evidently the friend contracts to help him freight it home.
Then, with a judgment peculiarly antic (pun not intentional), they take hold of opposite ends of that
grasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite directions. Presently they take a rest,
and confer together. They decide that something is wrong, they can’t make out what. Then they go at it
again, just as before. Same result. Mutual recriminations follow. Evidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist. They warm up, and the dispute ends in a fight. They lock themselves together and chew each other’s jaws for a while; then they roll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs. They make up and go to work again in the same old insane way, but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage; tug as he may, the other one drags off the booty and him at
the end of it. Instead of giving up, he hangs on, and gets his shins bruised against every obstruction
that comes in the way. By and by, when that grasshopper leg has been dragged all over the same old
ground once more, it is finally dumped at about the spot where it originally lay. The two perspiring
ants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property after all,
and then each starts off in a different direction to see if he can’t find an old nail or something else that
is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time valueless enough to make an ant want
to own it. . . .

4. Science has recently discovered that the ant does not lay up anything for winter use. . . . He does not
work, except when people are looking, and only then when the observer has a green, naturalistic look,
and seems to be taking notes. This amounts to deception, and will injure him for the Sunday schools.
He has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what isn’t. This amounts to ignorance,
and will impair the world’s respect for him. . . . He cannot stroll around a stump and find his way
home again. This amounts to idiocy, and once the damaging fact is established, thoughtful people will
cease to look up to him. It is strange beyond comprehension that so manifest a humbug as the ant has
been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many ages without being found out.
