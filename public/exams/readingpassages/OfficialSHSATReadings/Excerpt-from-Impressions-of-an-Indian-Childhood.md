*Zitkala-Sa (Gertrude Simmons Bonnin) was a Native American writer, musician, teacher, and
political activist who was raised on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. In 1900 she
published “Impressions of an Indian Childhood” (the term Indian was commonly used at the time
to refer to Native American people) to expose readers to what life is like on a reservation.*

### Excerpt from “Impressions of an Indian Childhood”

by Zitkala-Sa

1. Soon after breakfast Mother sometimes began her beadwork. On a bright, clear day, she pulled
out the wooden pegs that pinned the skirt of our wigwam1 to the ground, and rolled the canvas
part way up on its frame of slender poles. Then the cool morning breezes swept freely through
our dwelling, now and then wafting the perfume of sweet grasses from newly burnt prairie.

2. Untying the long tasseled strings that bound a small brown buckskin bag, my mother spread
upon a mat beside her bunches of colored beads, just as an artist arranges the paints upon his
palette. On a lapboard she smoothed out a double sheet of soft white buckskin; and drawing from
a beaded case that hung on the left of her wide belt a long, narrow blade, she trimmed the
buckskin into shape. Often she worked upon small moccasins for her small daughter. Then I
became intensely interested in her designing. With a proud, beaming face, I watched her work. In
\[\my] imagination, I saw myself walking in a new pair of snugly fitting moccasins. I felt the
envious eyes of my playmates upon the pretty red beads decorating my feet.

3. Close beside my mother I sat on a rug, with a scrap of buckskin in one hand and an awl in the
other. This was the beginning of my practical observation lessons in the art of beadwork. From a
skein of finely twisted threads of silvery sinews my mother pulled out a single one. With an awl
she pierced the buckskin, and skillfully threaded it with the white sinew. Picking up the tiny beads
one by one, she strung them with the point of her thread, always twisting it carefully after
every stitch.

4. It took many trials before I learned how to knot my sinew thread on the point of my finger, as I
saw her do. Then the next difficulty was in keeping my thread stiffly twisted, so that I could easily
string my beads upon it. My mother required of me original designs for my lessons in beading. At
first I frequently ensnared many a sunny hour into working a long design. Soon I learned from
self-inflicted punishment to refrain from drawing complex patterns, for I had to finish whatever
I began.

5. After some experience I usually drew easy and simple crosses and squares. These were some of
the set forms. My original designs were not always symmetrical nor sufficiently characteristic, two
faults with which my mother had little patience. The quietness of her oversight made me feel
strongly responsible and dependent upon my own judgment. She treated me as a dignified little
individual as long as I was on my good behavior; and how humiliated I was when some boldness
of mine drew forth a rebuke from her!

6. In the choice of colors she left me to my own taste. I was pleased with an outline of yellow upon a
background of dark blue, or a combination of red and myrtle-green. There was another of red with
a bluish-gray that was more conventionally used. When I became a little familiar with designing
and the various pleasing combinations of color, a harder lesson was given me. It was the sewing
on, instead of beads, some tinted porcupine quills, moistened and flattened between the nails of
the thumb and forefinger. My mother cut off the prickly ends and burned them at once in the
centre fire. These sharp points were poisonous, and worked into the flesh wherever they lodged.
For this reason, my mother said, I should not do much alone in quills until I was as tall as my
cousin Warca-Ziwin.

7. Always after these confining lessons I was wild with surplus spirits, and found joyous relief in
running loose in the open again. Many a summer afternoon a party of four or five of my
playmates roamed over the hills with me. We each carried a light sharpened rod about four feet
long, with which we pried up certain sweet roots. When we had eaten all the choice roots we
chanced upon, we shouldered our rods and strayed off into patches of a stalky plant under whose
yellow blossoms we found little crystal drops of gum. Drop by drop we gathered this nature’s
rock-candy, until each of us could boast of a lump the size of a small bird’s egg. Soon satiated
with its woody flavor, we tossed away our gum, to return again to the sweet roots.
