*Samuel Morse, an American inventor, is credited with creating the electronic telegraph, a*
*communication device that allows users to send messages using a system of short and long pulses that*
*represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. In 1844 the United States Congress passed the Telegraph*
*Bill, which provided Morse with the funds to build an electric telegraph system.*

### Invention of the Telegraph

**Earlier Signal Systems**

1. Long before Samuel F. B. Morse electrically transmitted his famous message “What hath God
wrought?” from Washington to Baltimore on May 24, 1844, there were signaling systems that enabled
people to communicate over distances. Most were visual or “semaphore” systems using flags or lights.
In the eighteenth century, such systems used an observer who would decipher a signal from a high
tower on a distant hill and then send it on to the next station. The young American republic wanted
just such a system along its entire Atlantic coast and offered a prize of $30,000 for a workable
proposal. The framers of this legislation had no way of knowing that when they used the word
“telegraph” to refer to this visual semaphore system, they would be offered an entirely new and
revolutionary means of communication—electricity.

**The Growth of an Idea**

2. The idea of using electricity to communicate over distance is said to have occurred to Morse during a
conversation aboard ship when he was returning from Europe in 1832. Michael Faraday’s recently
invented electromagnet was much discussed by the ship’s passengers, and when Morse came to
understand how it worked, he speculated that it might be possible to send a coded message over a
wire. While a student at Yale College years before, he had written his parents a letter about how
interesting he found the lectures on electricity. Despite what he had learned at Yale, Morse found
when he began to develop his idea that he had little real understanding of the nature of electricity,
and after sporadic attempts to work with batteries, magnets, and wires, he finally turned for help to a
colleague at the University of the City of New York, Leonard D. Gale.

3. Gale was a professor of chemistry and familiar with the electrical work of Princeton’s Joseph Henry, a
true pioneer in the new field. Well before Morse had his shipboard idea about a telegraph, Henry rang
a bell at a distance by opening and closing an electric circuit. In 1831, he had published an article, of
which Morse was unaware, that contained details suggesting the idea of an electric telegraph. Gale’s
help and his knowledge of this article proved crucial to Morse’s telegraph system because Gale not
only pointed out flaws in the system but showed Morse how he could regularly boost the strength of a
signal and overcome the distance problems he had encountered by using a relay system Henry had
invented. Henry’s experiments, Gale’s assistance, and, soon after, hiring the young technician Alfred
Vail were keys to Morse’s success.

**Obstacles and Opportunities**

4. By December 1837, Morse had enough confidence in his new system to apply for the federal
government’s appropriation, and during the next year he conducted demonstrations of his telegraph
both in New York and Washington.

5. However, when the economic disaster known as the Panic of 1837 took hold of the nation and caused a
long depression, Morse was forced to wait for better times. It was during this period that Morse visited
Europe again and tried not only to secure patent protection overseas but to examine competing
telegraph systems in England. . . .

6. By 1843, the country was beginning to recover economically, and Morse again asked Congress for the
$30,000 that would allow him to build a telegraph line from Washington to Baltimore, forty miles
away. The House of Representatives eventually passed the bill containing the Morse appropriation,
and the Senate approved it in the final hours of that Congress’s last session. With President Tyler’s
signature, Morse received the cash he needed and began to carry out plans for an underground
telegraph line.

**Realizing a Great Invention**
7. Morse had hired the ingenious construction engineer Ezra Cornell to lay the pipe carrying the wire,
and although Cornell did his job superbly, one of Morse’s partners, Congressman F. O. J. Smith, had
purchased wire with defective insulation. Too much time had been wasted laying bad wire, and with
the project on a rigid deadline, something had to be done quickly. Cornell suggested that the fastest
and cheapest way of connecting Washington and Baltimore was to string wires overhead on trees and
poles. The desperate Morse gave the go-ahead, and the line was completed in time for the dramatic
and spectacularly successful link between the Supreme Court chamber of the Capitol building and the
railroad station in Baltimore.

8. Soon, as overhead wires connected cities up and down the Atlantic coast, the dots-and-dashes method2
that recorded messages on a long moving strip of paper was replaced by the operator’s ability to
interpret the code in real time. . . . Telegraph lines soon extended westward, and within Morse’s own
lifetime they connected the continents of Europe and America.
