### Excerpt from “Niagara Falls”

by Rupert Brooke

1. The real secret of the beauty and terror of the Falls is not their height or width, but the feeling of
colossal power and of unintelligible disaster caused by the plunge of that vast body of water. If that
were taken away, there would be little visible change, but the heart would be gone.

2. The American Falls do not inspire this feeling in the same way as the Canadian. It is because they are
less in volume, and because the water does not fall so much into one place. By comparison their beauty
is almost delicate and fragile. They are extraordinarily level, one long curtain of lacework and woven
foam. Seen from opposite, when the sun is on them, they are blindingly white, and the clouds of spray
show dark against them. With both Falls the colour of the water is the ever-altering wonder. Greens
and blues, purples and whites, melt into one another, fade, and come again, and change with the
changing sun. Sometimes they are as richly diaphanous1 as a precious stone, and glow from within
with a deep, inexplicable light. Sometimes the white intricacies of dropping foam become opaque and
creamy. And always there are the rainbows. If you come suddenly upon the Falls from above, a great
double rainbow, very vivid, spanning the extent of spray from top to bottom, is the first thing you see.
If you wander along the cliff opposite, a bow springs into being in the American Falls, accompanies you
courteously on your walk, dwindles and dies as the mist ends, and awakens again as you reach the
Canadian tumult. And the bold traveller who attempts the trip under the American Falls sees, when
he dare open his eyes to anything, tiny baby rainbows, some four or five yards in span, leaping from
rock to rock among the foam, and gambolling beside him, barely out of hand’s reach, as he goes. One I
saw in that place was a complete circle, such as I have never seen before, and so near that I could put
my foot on it. It is a terrifying journey, beneath and behind the Falls. The senses are battered and
bewildered by the thunder of the water and the assault of wind and spray; or rather, the sound is not
of falling water, but merely of falling; a noise of unspecified ruin. So, if you are close behind the endless
clamour, the sight cannot recognise liquid in the masses that hurl past. You are dimly and pitifully
aware that sheets of light and darkness are falling in great curves in front of you. Dull omnipresent
foam washes the face. Farther away, in the roar and hissing, clouds of spray seem literally to slide
down some invisible plane of air.

3. Beyond the foot of the Falls the river is like a slipping floor of marble, green with veins of dirty white,
made by the scum that was foam. It slides very quietly and slowly down for a mile or two, sullenly
exhausted. Then it turns to a dull sage green, and hurries more swiftly, smooth and ominous. As the
walls of the ravine close in, trouble stirs, and the waters boil and eddy. These are the lower rapids, a
sight more terrifying than the Falls, because less intelligible. Close in its bands of rock the river surges
tumultuously forward, writhing and leaping as if inspired by a demon. It is pressed by the straits into
a visibly convex form. Great planes of water slide past. Sometimes it is thrown up into a pinnacle of
foam higher than a house, or leaps with incredible speed from the crest of one vast wave to another,
along the shining curve between, like the spring of a wild beast. Its motion continually suggests
muscular action. The power manifest in these rapids moves one with a different sense of awe and
terror from that of the Falls. Here the inhuman life and strength are spontaneous, active, almost
resolute. . . . A place of fear.

4. One is drawn back, strangely, to a contemplation of the Falls, at every hour, and especially by night,
when the cloud of spray becomes an immense visible ghost, straining and wavering high above the
river, white and pathetic and translucent. The Victorian lies very close below the surface in every man.
There one can sit and let great cloudy thoughts of destiny and the passage of empires drift through
the mind; for such dreams are at home by Niagara. I could not get out of my mind the thought of a
friend, who said that the rainbows over the Falls were like the arts and beauty and goodness, with
regard to the stream of life—caused by it, thrown upon its spray, but unable to stay or direct or affect
it, and ceasing when it ceased. In all comparisons that rise in the heart, the river, with its
multitudinous waves and its single current, likens itself to a life, whether of an individual or of a
community. A man’s life is of many flashing moments, and yet one stream; a nation’s flows through all
its citizens, and yet is more than they. In such places, one is aware, with an almost insupportable and
yet comforting certitude, that both men and nations are hurried onwards to their ruin or ending as
inevitably as this dark flood. Some go down to it unreluctant, and meet it, like the river, not without
nobility. And as incessant, as inevitable, and as unavailing as the spray that hangs over the Falls, is
the white cloud of human crying. . . . With some such thoughts does the platitudinous2 heart win from
the confusion and thunder of a Niagara peace that the quietest plains or most stable hills can
never give.
