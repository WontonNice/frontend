*The Great Serpent Mound, located in Adams County, Ohio, is a human-made mound of earth that
researchers believe was created between 300 B.C. and A.D. 1100 by an indigenous culture.*

### Serpent Mound
Ohio, 1846

Brush Creek stood low when the museum men came
with their measuring tapes and sketchbooks.
    It was winter. Fringed with ice,
    the creek doubled back on itself
as if it had forgotten something.
    Pa was in Cincinnati, or else on his way home,
        so Ma told me to lead the men
        into the marshy low grounds. It being winter,
            there was little underbrush to speak of—
            in the summer there would have been
    briars, poison ivy, biting flies. I listened
for the swish of a beaver’s heavy tail,
    the chitter of a chickadee, or the cry of a hawk,
    but the winter silence of the creek pressed
    down on all of us like a weight.
The humps in the ground were all but
invisible until you were right up on them. The figure
was even less obvious: the sinuous body,
    the tail coiled three times around,
    and at the other end, the mouth wide open.
        In the summer the creek bottom was crowded
        with so much life that you could trip over
            the ridges of earth before you saw
            anything at all. In winter you could climb
            a tree and get some idea of the whole thing:
        the serpent’s body undulating, slithering
silently across the ancient
    earth. At the mouth end, there was an oval mound
    as if the snake were about to swallow an egg—
as snakes sometimes did in our rickety
henhouse—my Pa always said, or
as if swallowing the sun, one of the museum
    men suggested, taking notes with his quill pen,
    an old-style inkhorn slung at his side.
    I liked that: swallowing the sun,
        just the sort of thing a snake might do,
        might want to do. When, later, I told my sister Ruth,
            she disagreed. It is singing to the sun,
            she insisted. That is why its mouth
        is wide open. She said, “Sometimes I think
I hear it on summer nights. Not swallowing, singing.”
