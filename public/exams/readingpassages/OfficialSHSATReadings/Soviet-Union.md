Imagine living in a society where ordinary
people could be punished for what they
choose to read and write. For much of the
twentieth century, such a closed society
existed in Russia and the rest of the Soviet
Union. The Soviet government tried to
dominate its citizens’ activities and ideas by
controlling the information that they
received. Government censors examined
books, films, and newscasts and banned
anything they considered objectionable. They
censored criticism of the Soviet government,
news from the outside world, and anything
that complimented Soviet enemies.

The Soviet government’s strict censorship
made life tremendously difficult for writers.
Most worried that they were being watched
by the government’s secret police. Despite the
harsh laws, small groups of writers dodged
state censorship through an underground, or
secret, publishing network that produced
works called samizdat. The name samizdat
came from the Russian words for “self” and
“publish.” For many writers, samizdat offered
the only outlet for their intellectual and
creative expression. To produce samizdat, an
author passed a typed or handwritten text to
a second person, who made a handwritten or
typed copy. The original was returned to the
author, while the copy was passed to other
members of the network. The works were
unsigned or signed with false names.

At first, samizdat focused mainly on
literature, such as poetry and novels. By the
late 1950s, samizdat circles were distributing
political material, such as letters to the
government, political essays, and trial
transcripts. By the mid-1960s, the samizdat
network produced sophisticated political
news, debate, and analysis.

The great Russian novelist Boris Pasternak
had his work published as samizdat. Like
other writers, he feared that an appearance
of disloyalty to the Soviet state would bring a
knock at his door in the middle of the night.
His classic novel Doctor Zhivago was
smuggled out of the Soviet Union for
publication in Western countries in 1956; in
Russia, it appeared only as samizdat.
Pasternak won the Nobel Prize in Literature
in 1958, but the government forced him to
refuse the prize. Soviet authorities also
blocked publication of the work of Anna
Akhmatova, one of Russia’s greatest poets.
Her work was banned until 1952 because
censors thought she did not sufficiently
praise the Soviet government. Akhmatova
was kept out of public life and the official
Writers’ Union. She composed her poetry in
private, and her works were available only as
samizdat.

Through the 1960s and ’70s, Russian writers
used samizdat networks to circulate banned
or politically risky material. By the late
1980s, computers became available in
scientific research facilities, and underground
writers began using the computers to store
and circulate texts. Censorship was officially
abolished in 1989, shortly before the breakup
of the Soviet Union, leading to a publishing
boom. Works by previously banned authors
were published, and the samizdat networks
quickly faded into history.
