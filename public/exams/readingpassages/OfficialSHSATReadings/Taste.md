When you eat an orange, your experience of
its flavor comes from the combination of its
aroma and its taste. Taste buds, the sensory
receptors on the tongue, convey information
to the brain about chemicals in food while the
food dissolves in saliva. The sense of smell
comes into play when the olfactory nerve in
the nasal passages senses even very low
concentrations of food chemicals in gaseous
form. The sense of smell has a larger role in
tasting flavors than most people realize—
that is, until they have a stuffy nose and
nothing tastes good.

If taste and smell depend on our detection of
food chemicals, one might expect that
chemists would be able to duplicate the
flavors of foods. In fact, a surprising number
of popular food flavors can now be reproduced
in the laboratory, and even more are on the
way. Orange, perhaps the most popular flavor
worldwide, has been reproduced successfully.
So have some national favorites, including
cashew (Latin America), paprika (Hungary),
and fruit-flavored Jamaica (Mexico).
Synthetic flavors are not limited to flavoring
food; they are also added to mouthwashes,
toothpastes, beverages, and other consumer
products.

Only a small proportion of the chemical
components occurring naturally in foods
actually contributes to their flavor. To
identify these critical components, scientists
use a gas chromatograph to separate a food
into its basic chemical constituents. Flavor
experts, called flavorists, then attempt to
isolate those chemicals that are essential to
the distinctive flavor of a food. Mechanical
techniques have been developed to capture
the aromas of food as it is being prepared—
such as the smell of baking bread—and distill
the essential chemicals from these essences.
Flavorists use their highly developed senses
of taste and smell to attempt to produce
acceptable flavorings that are chemically
identical to, but purer than, flavors that are
naturally present in unprocessed food.

Although American consumers claim to want
“natural” flavors in their food, taste tests
demonstrate that they often prefer their
synthetically produced counterparts.
Artificial flavors tend to be stronger and less
subtle than natural flavors. For example,
many Americans prefer a soft drink created
with artificial flavors, such as orange soda,
over an “all-natural” soda flavored with real
oranges, which may taste weak in
comparison. In fact, some flavorists worry
that consumers will develop such a strong
taste for artificial flavors that natural
flavorings, usually more expensive than their
artificial counterparts, will become scarce.

Researchers have not always been successful
in their efforts to duplicate natural flavors.
Some popular flavors, such as coffee,
strawberry, and chocolate, have proven
virtually impossible to reproduce. The
difficulty in creating a flavor like chocolate,
experts say, is its complexity—a mysterious
combination of sweet and bitter that excites
the taste buds in an unusual and satisfying
way.
