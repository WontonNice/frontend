### Uncovering the Past

by Rupert Brooke

1. Archaeology as a distinct branch of science is only about two centuries old. The first archaeological
activities focused largely on the search for clues about earlier human societies. In the nineteenth
century, most archaeologists were amateurs trained in ancient languages and history. Many were art
historians whose interest lay in the artwork and monuments of ancient civilizations. For the most
part, their excavations were aimed at uncovering and removing priceless artwork and other valuable
artifacts for museum display. Collectively, these early archaeologists are now considered
traditional archaeologists.

2. Today, however, there is a different approach to archaeology, one that tries to reconstruct the everyday
life of people in ancient times by applying the scientific methods of a range of specialized fields.
Modern archaeologists take full advantage of available technology. Laptop computers enable digging
teams to record their finds at each level of an excavation. With sketchpad computer software,
archaeologists can draw their finds in the field. Three-dimensional computer modeling enables
researchers to create floor plans and elevations for the structures they uncover. Archaeologists can
also use remote sensing technologies such as radar and lidar, which is similar to radar but it uses
laser light instead of radio waves. These technologies enable scientists to detect traces of early
settlements that are not visible to the human eye.

3. The excavations at Kourion, a Roman port city on the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea,
serve as an example of the modern approach. Portions of Kourion had been unexpectedly buried by a
massive earthquake in the fourth century A.D. Traditional archaeologists were interested primarily in
the remains of Kourion’s theater, temple, and classical monuments. They also collected precious
objects, such as jewelry, found in nearby tombs. Modern archaeologists, however, have focused their
studies and excavations on the settlement itself. This preserved seaport has proved to be a gold mine
of important information about everyday life sixteen centuries ago.

4. During one excavation of a house at Kourion, for example, forensic anthropologists were able to
reconstruct the skeleton of a young girl, whom they called Camelia. On the basis of her teeth, they
determined her age to be about thirteen, although measurement of her skeleton showed that she was
only the size of a modern eleven-year-old. The study of the teeth also confirmed her sex and pointed to
her excellent health; Camelia had no cavities. Even after centuries, the forensic scientists could study
the physical evidence in ways similar to those used in criminal investigations to determine the
circumstances of Camelia’s death.

5. Other specialists on this excavation included a zooarchaeologist, who identified animal remains,
including the skeleton of a mule found near Camelia. Another specialist, a paleobotanist, studied the
contents of a bake oven at the site and identified four domesticated grains among the charred
crumbs—evidence of a kind of ancient multigrain bread.

6. Although the archaeologists at this site unearthed a few beautiful items, the excavation did not
uncover any priceless artwork for museums. Nonetheless, the archaeological processes used in
Kourion have given us a valuable insight into everyday life in a Roman city
