### Rock On

1. A rocking chair is any type of chair that has the ability to rock back and forth on a pair of curved bands. These bands are typically attached to the bottom of the chair’s legs, and allow a person sitting in the chair to shift his or her weight forward and backward in the chair. This results in a rocking motion, after which the chairs are named.

2. In the United States, many believe that Benjamin Franklin, a scientist and prolific inventor, first created the rocking chair. In fact, most historians agree that rocking chairs were already prevalent throughout North America by the time Franklin was born. These chairs were usually made of wood, and were often used around the house or outdoors, in gardens. Sometimes, the chairs were also made of wicker, plant-based fibers derived from stalks or branches, which were woven together. The use of this pliable material also allowed for more creative and intricate designs. As a result, by the 18th century, American wicker rocking chairs were prized for their craftsmanship.

3. However, due to their size and weight, the chairs were not very portable. Moving the chairs from one place to another was cumbersome, so rocking chairs were usually left in place. The chairs remained this way for much of the next hundred years. It was not until the 19th century when a German craftsman developed a new technique for making chairs more lightweight that rocking chairs began to gain widespread appeal. In the 20th century, craftsmen developed the folding rocking chair. Combined with developments in making the chairs more lightweight, the ability to fold the chairs made them even more portable and, therefore, popular.

4. The rocking chair became so famous, in fact, that even a President of the United States took a liking to it. President John F. Kennedy liked his rocking chair so much that he had it brought onto the presidential aircraft, Air Force One. On top of this, Kennedy purchased more rocking chairs for Camp David as well as his private properties. He even gave chairs to visiting heads of state!

5. Today, the rocking chair that sat in the White House during Kennedy’s presidency is on display at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum. This artifact highlights the prevalence of the rocking chair in American culture. It is a reminder of how such a humble, everyday object can be liked even by someone so powerful and prominent.
