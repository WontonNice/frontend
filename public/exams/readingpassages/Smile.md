### Smile!

1. Almost one hundred fifty years ago, Charles Darwin, the famous British naturalist, proposed a startling new theory about the cause of human emotions. Facial expressions, he argued, are more than the visible signs of an emotion; to some extent they actually cause the emotion. For example, a person’s smile reflects a feeling of happiness, but it also helps to produce that feeling. The theory that facial expressions contributed to emotions was controversial and, at the time, impossible to prove. Eventually it lost favor, and for more than a century people’s facial expressions were assumed to be the result, not the cause, of their feelings.

2. Theories change, however. Within the last few decades, psychologists have been investigating the notion that we can put smiles in our hearts by first putting them on our faces. In a research study, volunteers were asked to say words that placed their facial muscles into either smiles or frowns. The purpose of the task was not explained. After the experiment, the volunteers who said words like “cheese” were measurably happier than those who said words like “few.”

3. To explain these results, the researchers theorized that there is a relationship between facial expressions and the temperature of the blood entering the brain. According to their theory, the muscle contractions produced by a facial expression raise or lower the temperature of the blood that flows through the person’s face. The change in temperature is slight—less than one degree Celsius. The blood vessels in the face connect to the carotid artery, which leads to the hypothalamus, an area of the brain believed to regulate emotions. The researchers theorized that warmer blood, which is associated with frowning or scowling, leads to feelings of unhappiness. A smile, which is created by a different set of muscles, lowers the blood temperature and tends to produce a feeling of happiness.

4. In another study, volunteers were told exactly which facial muscles to contract. For example, volunteers were told, “Raise your eyebrows, open your eyes wide, tuck in your chin, and let your mouth relax” (the facial expression associated with fear). The volunteers were not told which emotion they were mimicking. As they produced the muscular movements of a particular emotional expression, they tended to experience that emotion. For example, while making a fearful expression, they reported feeling more fear than anger, sadness, or disgust.

5. Acceptance of the research relating emotions to facial expressions, especially the blood temperature theory, is far from universal. However, some psychologists hope that the phenomenon may be useful in treating mild depression. They do agree, though, that facial expressions are not the most important causes of emotion. Encouraging people to smile while they are mourning, for example, would do little to lessen their grief.
