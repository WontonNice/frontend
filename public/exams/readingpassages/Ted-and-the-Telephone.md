### Adapted from Ted and the Telephone
by Sara Bassett

1. Mr. Wharton was about the last person on earth one would have connected with boxes of strings and wires hidden away beneath beds. He was a graduate of a Massachusetts agricultural college, and was a keen-eyed, quick, impatient creature toward whom people in general stood somewhat in awe. He had the reputation of being a top-notch farmer and those who knew him declared with zest that there was nothing he did not know about soils, fertilizers, and crops. There was no nonsense when Mr. Wharton appeared on the scene. The men who worked for him soon found that out. You didn’t lean on your shovel, take a drink of water, and hazard a guess about tomorrow’s weather; you just worked as hard as you could and did not stop for anything.

2. Now it happened that it was harvest time both at Aldercliffe and Pine Lea and the rumor got around that the crop was an unusually heavy one. Word was that Mr. Wharton was short of help and ready to hire extra men from the adjoining village at a good wage. Mr. Turner brought the news home from the mill one June night when he returned from work.

3. “Why don’t you try for a job up at Aldercliffe, my lad?” concluded he, after stating the case. “Ever since you were knee-high to a grasshopper you had a knack for pitching hay. Besides, you’d make a fine bit of money and the work would be no heavier than handling freight down at the mills. You’ve got to work somewhere through your summer vacation.”

4. He made the latter statement as a matter of course for a matter of course it had long since become. Ted always worked when he was not studying. Vacations, holidays, Saturdays, he was always busy earning money for if he had not been, there would have been no chance of his going to school the rest of the time. Sometimes he did errands for one of the dry-goods stores; sometimes, if there were a vacancy, he helped in Fernald and Company’s shipping rooms; sometimes he worked at the town market or rode about on the grocer’s wagon, delivering orders. By one means or another he had usually contrived, since he was quite a small boy, to pick up odd sums that went toward his clothes and “keep .” As he grew older, these sums had increased until now they had become a recognized part of the family income. For it was understood that Ted would contribute to the household expenses all that he earned. His father had never believed in a boy having money to spend, and even if he had every cent which the Turners could scrape together was needed at home. Ted knew well how much sugar and butter cost, and therefore without demur he cheerfully placed in the hands of his sister Ruth, who ran the house, every penny that was given him.

5. From childhood this sense of responsibility had always been in his background. He had known what it was to go hungry that he might have shoes and go without shoes that he might have underwear. Money had been very scarce on the Vermont farm, and although there was now more of it than there ever had been in the past, nevertheless it was not plentiful. Therefore, as vacation was approaching and he must get a job anyway, he decided to present himself before Mr. Wharton and ask for a chance to help in harvesting the hay crops at Aldercliffe and Pine Lea.

6. “You are younger than the men I am hiring,” Mr. Wharton said, after he had scanned the lad critically. “How old are you?”

7. “Fourteen.”

8. “I thought as much. What I want is men.”

9. “But I have farmed all my life,” protested Ted with spirit.

10. “Indeed!” the manager exclaimed not unkindly. “Where?”

11. “In Vermont, at Newfane.”

12. Instantly the man’s face lighted.

13. “I know that place well. And you came from Newfane here? How did you happen to do that?”

14. “My father could not make the farm pay and we needed money.”

15. “Humph! Were you sorry to give up farming?”

16. “Yes, sir. I didn’t want to come to Freeman’s Falls. But,” added the boy brightening, “I like the school here.”

17. The manager paused, studying the sharp, eager face, the spare figure, and the fine carriage of the lad before him.

18. “Do you like haying?” asked he presently.

19. “Not particularly,” Ted owned with honesty.

20. Mr. Wharton laughed.

21. “I see you are a human boy,” he said. “If you don’t like it, why are you so anxious to do it now?”

22. “I’ve got to earn some money or give up going to school in the fall.”

23. For comment Mr. Wharton tipped back in his chair and once more let his eye wander over the boy’s face; then he wheeled abruptly around to his desk, opened a drawer, and took out a yellow card across which he scrawled a line with his fountain pen.

24. “You may begin work to-morrow morning,” he remarked curtly. “If it is pleasant, Stevens will be cutting the further meadow with a gang of men. Come promptly at eight o’clock, prepared to stay all day, and bring this card with you.”
