### Adapted from The Black Hand

by Arthur B. Reeve

1. Kennedy and I had been dining rather late one evening at Luigi’s, a little Italian restaurant on the lower West Side. We had known the place well in our student days, and we have visited it once a month ever since, in order to keep in practice in the fine art of gracefully handling long shreds of spaghetti. As a result, we did not think it strange when the proprietor himself stopped a moment at our table to greet us. Glancing furtively around at the other diners, who were mostly Italians, he suddenly leaned over and whispered to Kennedy:

2. “I have heard of your wonderful detective work, Professor. Could you give a little advice in the case of a friend of mine?”

3. “Surely, Luigi. What is the case?” asked Craig, leaning back in his chair.

4. Luigi glanced around again apprehensively and lowered his voice. “Not so loud, sir. When you pay your check, go out, walk around Washington Square, and come in at the private entrance. I’ll be waiting in the hall. My friend is dining privately upstairs.”

5. We lingered a while over our wine, then quietly paid the check and departed.

6. True to his word, Luigi was waiting for us in the dark hall. With a motion that indicated silence, he led us up the stairs to the second floor, and quickly opened a door into what seemed to be a mid-sized private dining-room. A man was pacing the floor nervously. On a table was some food, untouched. As the door opened, I thought he started as if in fear, and I am sure his dark face blanched, if only for an instant. Imagine our surprise at seeing Gennaro, the great opera singer, with whom merely to have a speaking acquaintance was to make oneself famous.

7. “Oh, it is you, Luigi,” he exclaimed in perfect English, rich and mellow. “And who are these gentlemen?”

8. Luigi merely replied, “Friends,” in English also, and then dropped off into a voluble, low-toned explanation in Italian.

9. I could see, as we waited, that the same idea had flashed over Kennedy’s mind as over my own. It was now three or four days since the papers had reported the strange kidnapping of Gennaro’s five-year-old daughter Adelina, his only child, and the sending of a demand for ten thousand dollars ransom, signed, as usual, with the mystic Black Hand – a name to conjure with in blackmail and extortion.

10. As Signor Gennaro advanced toward us, after his short talk with Luigi, almost before the introductions were over, Kennedy anticipated him by saying: “I understand, Signor, before you ask me. I have read all about it in the papers. You want someone to help you catch the criminals who are holding your little girl.”

11. “No, no!” exclaimed Gennaro excitedly. “Not that. I want to get my daughter first. After that, catch them if you can – yes, I should like to have someone do it. But read this first and tell me what you think of it. How should I act to get my little Adelina back without harming a hair of her head?” The famous singer drew from a capacious pocketbook a dirty, crumpled letter, scrawled on cheap paper.

12. Kennedy translated it quickly. It read:

13. Honorable sir: your daughter is in safe hands. But if you give this letter to the police as you did the other, you will regret it. We will not fail as we did Wednesday. If you want your daughter back, go to Enrico Albano’s on Saturday night at midnight. Make sure you come alone, without telling anyone. Bring $10,000 in cash, and hide the money in Saturday’s Il Progresso Italiano. In the back room, you will see a man sitting alone at a table. He will have a red flower on his coat. You will say to him, “A fine opera is ‘I Pagliacci.’” If he answers, “Not without Gennaro,” lay the newspaper down on the table. He will pick it up, leaving his own, the Bolletino. On the third page you will find the address of your daughter’s location. Go immediately and get her. We promise we will deal fairly with you if you follow all our instructions. This is your last warning. In case you forget, we will show you one other sign of our power tomorrow.

14. The end of this letter was decorated with skull and crossbones, a circle of X’s, and, underneath it all, a huge black hand. There was no doubt about the type of letter. In recent years, it has become increasingly common in all our large cities.
