### The Ghost Station

Below the city’s hurried feet,
Where steel on steel makes thunder meet,
A platform sleeps in settled dust,
A kingdom given up to rust.
The tile work, cracked and missing, shows
A faded, half-forgotten rose,
And posters on the sweating wall
Proclaim a long-forgotten call.

No train now stops, no doors slide wide,
No hurried crowds now stand inside.
Just echoes of a bygone sound,
Trapped in the silence underground.
A single bulb, in stubborn light,
Keeps vigil in the endless night,
A lonely star that cannot fade,
In this forgotten cavalcade.

The tracks are ghosts of silver lines,
That lead to nowhere, lost designs.
The air is thick with what has been—
A phantom rush, a phantom din.
This place was once a beating heart,
A stage to play a daily part,
But progress has a heavy tread,
And leaves its living for its dead.
