### There and Back Again

(1) For some time, people living in cities avoided uncomfortable weather by going to other places. (2) In the New York City area, popular destinations include those on Long Island, as well as in New Jersey. (3) Some of these include Asbury Park, Long Beach Island, Montauk, and East Hampton.

(4) In the late 19th century, a brush manufacturer James Bradley, began developing the central coast of New Jersey, in the area that we now know of as Asbury Park. (5) Asbury Park, a town with a total land area of 1.6 square miles, was incorporated in 1874. (6) Bradley was responsible for bringing a great deal of infrastructure to the area, including the now-famous boardwalk, an orchestra pavilion, public changing rooms, and a pier. (7) This infrastructure attracted other businessmen, like Ernest Schnitzler, who built the iconic Palace Merry-Go-Round nearby. (8) With these and other developments, such as numerous high-end hotels and carnival rides, Asbury Park launched into a decades-long era of popularity and prosperity, drawing the well-heeled from near and far.

(9) Nearly a century later, what was once known as “the country by the sea” became known as “Beirut by the Shore” or “Sarajevo by the Sea” – references to notoriously war-torn cities in Europe. (10) In the 1960s, the wealthy moved to suburbs away from the coast, taking with them the money that had made the city hum. (11) By the 1970s, race riots devastated the city both physically and in reputation. (12) By the 1980s, Asbury Park was practically a ghost town. (13) Some people were still able to continue living in the town.

(14) Though the city remained impoverished and largely forgotten for decades, at the turn of the millennium, New Yorkers once again took note. (15) Rather than vacation in the expensive and crowded beaches of Long Island, some New Yorkers decided to take the short train ride directly from Pennsylvania Station to Asbury Park. (16) There, they found a relaxed atmosphere and affordable seaside real estate.

(17) For example, Cookman Avenue is already a destination in and of itself, famous for its art and antique shops. (18) More and more visitors – many from Manhattan – are making their way to Asbury Park to see for themselves what the fuss is. (19) What they find are no longer the deals and value to be had just a few years earlier. (20) Slowly but surely, the lines get longer and the beaches more crowded.
