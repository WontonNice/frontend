### All About the Seeds

(1) According to the scientific definition, a fruit is the part of a plant’s flower that, when developed, contains the seed of that plant. (2) Mostly, what science says is a fruit matches with our normal, usual understanding of what a fruit is. (3) After all, apples, watermelon, oranges, and countless other fruits fit this definition neatly. (4) Fruits are, after all, full of the vitamins and nutrients that are an essential part of a healthy diet.

(5) However, in a few rare instances, the scientific definition of a fruit does not align with our everyday understanding. (6) Take, for example, the tomato. (7) These red, juicy morsels are found in the vegetable section of most supermarkets, and are treated like vegetables in most peoples diets. (8) Scientifically speaking, however, since a tomato grows from a plant’s flowers and contains its seeds, tomatoes are not vegetables, but fruits!

(9) The scientific definition of a word should not always determine how people use it in daily conversation. (10) If people start calling a tomato a fruit, the supermarket would become a very confusing place. (11) Even certain crunchy green vegetables, like cucumbers and zucchini, would need to be moved to the fruit aisle. (12) These vegetables also meet the scientific definition of a fruit. (13) Creamy avocados and tangy olives? (14) They too grow from flowers, contain seeds, and would need to be moved to the fruit aisle. (15) Even pods of peas are, scientifically, fruits.

(16) Even the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it would be ridiculous to classify a tomato as fruit. (17) In an 1893 case, the court decided that tomatoes should be taxed as a vegetable, not as a fruit. (18) The decision was unanimous; all of the courts judges agreed that the scientific definition of a word was not necessarily more important than its common usage. (19) As a result, even today, tomatoes are taxed as vegetables.

(20) Does a tomato meet the scientific criteria of a fruit? (21) It certainly does. (22) But does that mean that people should start referring to a tomato as a fruit? (23) No. (24) From supermarket shoppers to Supreme Court justices, people know that the tomato is a vegetable.
