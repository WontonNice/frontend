### Cracking the Code

(1) Computer code is part of every electronic interaction, from video games to home thermostats to
vehicle GPS systems. (2) Code is a language that computers can interpret, and programmers use it to
instruct computers to perform different tasks, such as finding, sorting, or calculating data. (3) People
who code have to learn this language. (4) They can construct programs that will perform detailed tasks.
(5) The programs can also perform complex tasks.

(6) A coding language uses letters, numbers, and symbols that are arranged in a way that makes sense to
a computer. (7) The code that makes up a program tells a computer how to process information.
(8) Studying a coding language involves learning the rules for combining phrases and instructions so
that they are recognizable to the computer. (9) Once a person understands coding rules, the possibilities
for applying them are infinite.

(10) Coding skills are becoming important in many occupational fields. (11) For example, code can be
used to create programs to track, analyze, and predict changes in the stock market. (12) Code can also
be designed to help doctors track and monitor a patient’s health. (13) Jobs that require coding skills are
typically higher paying, offering salaries that are up to as much as $22,000 a year more than jobs that do
not require coding knowledge.

(14) People have a variety of opportunities to learn how to code. (15) In some schools, young people can
study computer science and coding just as they study foreign languages. (16) Computer science teachers
can use websites and apps that employ games designed to help everyone understand how code works.
(17) Even high school students who do not take computer science can learn coding by attending coding
workshops and online classes or by watching tutorials online. (18) After studying the basics of coding,
some students may become interested in learning how to create programs, such as games and apps.

(19) The late Steve Jobs, a pioneer in computer technology, once said, “Everybody in this country should
learn how to program a computer . . . because it teaches you how to think.” (20) Learning to code can
seem challenging, but one does not need to become an expert programmer to reap the benefits of
understanding this language.
