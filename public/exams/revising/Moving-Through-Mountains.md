### Moving Through Mountains

(1) An age-old proverb says that necessity is the mother of invention. (2) Centuries of human ingenuity
in the face of obstacles prove this to be true. (3) For many years the Swiss Alps, a mountain range
spanning southern Switzerland and northern Italy, were such an obstacle. (4) Roads and railways had to
navigate around the mountains or through winding tunnels inside the mountains. (5) Transportation of
people and goods was difficult and time consuming. (6) In 2016 these burdens were eased with the
completion of the Gotthard Base Tunnel.

(7) Construction of the high-speed railway tunnel began in 1996. (8) The tunnel was created through the
use of tunnel-boring machines, which are giant drills with a rotating head. (9) Each of the tunnel-boring
machines used during the construction of the tunnel was about the length of four football fields arranged
end-to-end. (10) During the seventeen-year construction period, 28 million tons of rock were removed,
enough to rebuild the Great Pyramid at Giza five times. (11) This massive construction project is
reported to have cost $12 billion. (12) After that, 4 million cubic meters of concrete, or enough concrete to
build eighty-four Empire State Buildings, were used to construct and support the tunnel.

(13) By 2020 the high-speed railway will carry more than 250 freight trains and fifty-five passenger
trains a day, with most traveling at speeds of around 100 to 125 miles an hour. (14) It will be faster for
people to travel between northern and southern Europe. (15) The travel time between the European
cities of Zurich, Switzerland, and Milan, Italy, will be reduced by an hour. (16) Many European leaders
compare the Gotthard Base Tunnel to the Channel Tunnel, a 33-mile underwater tunnel that connects
the United Kingdom and France. (17) While there is no roadway in the Channel Tunnel, people can
drive their cars onto special trains that will carry vehicles through to the other side.

(18) The Gotthard Base Tunnel project was successful, so now there is renewed interest in solving other
problems associated with traveling to and from certain places. (19) Just as traffic congestion in major
cities led to the construction of underground local transportation, natural formations, such as mountain
ranges, have also sent people underground for faster, easier, and cheaper methods of transportation
across larger areas.
