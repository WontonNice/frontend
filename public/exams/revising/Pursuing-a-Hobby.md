### Pursuing a Hobby

(1) A hobby is an activity or interest that a person pursues for pleasure or relaxation. (2) For some it is a
sport or a game, while for others it is an art, a craft, or a volunteer opportunity. (3) Becoming involved in
a hobby can seem difficult and time consuming, but that should not stop people from pursuing one.
(4) Hobbies can be an outlet for the stress of everyday life. (5) School, work, family responsibilities, and
relationships can all compete for a person’s time and attention. (6) Many people exhibit psychological
symptoms of stress, such as boredom, tension, and anxiety. (7) Others report physical symptoms,
including low energy, headaches, and insomnia. (8) Reading books, creating works of art, or playing
games can give the human mind a reprieve from stress. (9) But stress relief is not the only benefit of
pursuing a hobby.
(10) People who regularly pursue a hobby spend time in what is called active leisure. (11) Active leisure
involves doing an activity that is relaxing but that also expends some mental or physical energy, such as
following a pattern to knit a scarf, analyzing statistics about a favorite sports team, or doing light
noncompetitive exercise. (12) During active leisure, people may experience what experts call flow, or a
state of effortless concentration. (13) Pursuing a stimulating hobby can help a person find flow, which
psychologists believe is more relaxing and restorative than passive leisure activities, such as watching
television. (14) Many successful businesspeople and celebrities have said that they pursue hobbies in
their free time.
(15) Another benefit of hobbies is that they can encourage positive social interaction among people with
similar interests. (16) A hobbyist might decide to do something to get better at a hobby or go to places
with other people interested in the hobby. (17) Making connections and having discussions with fellow
hobbyists can enhance a person’s knowledge about a hobby while fostering new friendships.
(18) Free time is a precious commodity, and spending it engaged in a hobby has many advantages.
(19) Finding an enjoyable hobby may take effort, but the physical, mental, and social effects of engaging
in a hobby are overwhelmingly positive.
