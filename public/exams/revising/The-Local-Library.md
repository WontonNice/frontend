### The Local Library

(1) According to a 2015 survey, more than two-thirds of Americans own a smartphone, which means that
obtaining information or communicating with people is easier than ever before. (2) With the swipe of a
finger or the tap of an icon, people have instant access to articles, blogs, news, and social networking
websites. (3) Even with all these immediate sources, one of the best resources also happens to be one of
the oldest. (4) The public library is a great place for people to get information.

(5) The public library serves a truly critical role in promoting community. (6) There has been an
explosion of digital media in recent years. (7) This now allows people in different places to communicate
almost instantaneously. (8) And yet many people complain of feeling more isolated and alone than ever
before. (9) The library stands in a unique position to help community members meet this universal need
for human connection and companionship.

(10) Furthermore, libraries offer free assistance, training programs, and Internet access to all people.
(11) A student who does not have a computer at home can research and type a paper for school. (12) An
unemployed adult without access to the Internet can make use of library resources to find job
opportunities. (13) A library’s selection of materials, known as its collection, can include classic novels,
reference books, magazines, periodicals, CDs, and DVDs. (14) The stuff that is found at the library can
help people get a lot done.

(15) Public libraries also offer a variety of resources to community members. (16) One important
resource is the local librarian, who does far more than check out books and collect fines. (17) Other
library resources include free or low-cost tutoring and training programs. (18) Additionally, lectures,
book groups, and town meetings promote critical thinking and community engagement. (19) A typical
librarian holds a master’s degree and can help library patrons navigate through the flood of information
available in print or on the Internet.

(20) The hallmark of a public library is that its materials and services are accessible to all. (21) The
library connects people to a network of information and resources and is an important part of a
community
