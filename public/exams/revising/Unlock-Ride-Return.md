### Unlock, Ride, Return

(1) In metropolitan areas around the world, millions of cars, trucks, and taxis pack the streets every day,
causing headaches for commuters and polluting the environment. (2) Public transportation eases some
of this congestion, but crowding and potential delays are still an issue for many travelers. (3) In recent
years, another transportation option has been gaining momentum in some cities. (4) This option is all
about sharing bicycles, which is a creative and new idea for some.
(5) The bike share concept is fairly simple. (6) Bike stations are set up at multiple locations in a city.
(7) Frequent users can purchase a membership pass, while less-frequent users or tourists can buy a daily
permit. (8) Many city bikers prefer bike sharing over ownership. (9) They are not responsible for the
bike’s storage or its maintenance. (10) Tourists also benefit from having an affordable way to experience
the sites of a city.
(11) The largest bike sharing program in the United States today is in New York City. (12) Known as
Citi Bike, the program was launched in 2013 and now boasts 10,000 bikes spread across 600 stations in
Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. (13) Similarly, in Hangzhou, China, a city of 7 million residents,
there are approximately 75,000 bikes offered across 2,700 stations. (14) In 2016, people used Citi Bike
for a lot of trips, which turned out to be a huge increase in the number of people taking rides from the
previous year. (15) These numbers are likely to increase further, since the program is set to expand into
additional neighborhoods soon. (16) According to Citi Bike, the bike sharing concept has gained rapid
popularity because it is “faster than walking, cheaper than a taxi, and more fun than the subway.”
(17) New York City officials estimated that in 2016 the bike share program had kept nearly 5,000 tons of
carbon dioxide out of the city’s air. (18) Officials in Montreal, Canada, and Lyon, France, have noted
similar impacts on air quality.
(19) As populations grow, fuel costs increase, and environmental concerns escalate, people will continue
to search for more economical and environmentally friendly ways to travel. (20) Bike sharing is a new
mode of transportation.
