It was ecologist Charles Elton, back in the 1950s, who introduced the militaristic 'invasion' metaphor to describe exotic plants and animals—but there’s no question some can be extremely destructive.\n\n2) The brown tree snake has eaten a dozen kinds of forest birds in Guam to extinction; zebra mussels clog pipes around the Great Lakes; the common house cat turns out to be, in Australia, a mercilessly effective killer of cute, fluffy marsupials like the bilby and the numbat.\n\n3) As scientists have sounded the alarm about these pests, the public has gotten the message: species that move into new habitats are dangerous invaders that must be eradicated. But the reality is more complicated.",
