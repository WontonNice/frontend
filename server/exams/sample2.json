      "passageMarkdown": "### Excerpt from *“The Science of Sleep”*\n\nby Dana Lee\n\n1) Most people underestimate the importance of sleep. It is not merely a time of rest, but an active state during which the brain organizes memories, clears toxins, and restores energy for the day ahead.\n\n2) In one experiment, participants who slept less than six hours per night for a week performed as poorly on attention tests as those who had gone two nights without sleep. Their reaction times slowed, and they made more mistakes.\n\n3) Sleep deprivation doesn’t just affect the brain—it also affects the body. Hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism are disrupted, which can lead to overeating and weight gain. Chronic sleep loss has even been linked to heart disease and diabetes.\n\n4) Scientists now believe that quality sleep is one of the best predictors of long-term health. It’s not a luxury—it’s a biological necessity.",
